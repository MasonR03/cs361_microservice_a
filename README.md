# Stock Balance Totals Microservice
# CS361 Microservice A

This microservice updates stock balance data stored in a CSV file by recalculating each stock's total (quantity * current_price) and ensuring that the `total_balance` row is correctly maintained. It also supports monitoring the CSV file for changes using Python's watchdog library, as well as the ability to return the total balance with a function call.
